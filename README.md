# F1 world champions

This project is a single page application that presents a list that shows the F1 world champions starting from 2005 until 2015 using http://ergast.com/mrd/. Clicking on an item shows the list of the winners for every race for the selected year. I have also highlighted the row when the winner has been the world champion in the same season.

It has been developed in Angular 5 framework and Test scripts has been written in Jasmine.
